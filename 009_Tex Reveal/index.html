            <h2>Hot Season</h2>
            <p>The hot season (known as ruedu ron) is most notable in the north of the country where temperatures are more changeable throughout the year. In spots like Chiang Mai average temperatures peak at around 37C in April - with minimal breeze and relatively little rainfall, this can make it a very difficult time of year to visit.

            <br>The hot season is less pronounced in the south of the country with temperatures peaking closer to 33C in Phuket.</p>

            <h2>Wet Season</h2>
            <p>During the wet season (known as reudu fon), the weather is dominated by the southwest monsoon which brings warm humid air to the country from the Indian Ocean which results in abundant rain throughout these months. Rain does tend to fall on most days but tends to come in short bursts of an hour or two in the afternoon or overnight, with the heaviest rain falling in September and October.

            <br>While it is not the hottest time of the year, the high humidity caused by the SW monsoon can make the wet season an uncomfortable time to visit Thailand.
                
            <br>Its worth noting that the monsoon also brings consistent onshore winds which creates reliable breaks if you're planning on surfing the Thai coast.</p>

            <h2>Cool Season</h2>
            <p>The cool season (ruedu nao) brings a significant turn in weather conditions with the north-east monsoon changing the prevailing wind directions. This brings in cool, dry air resulting in cooler temperatures and more comfortable humidity. This also means less rainfall and its is this combination that makes the cool season arguably the best time of year to visit much of Thailand.

            <br>During the cool season, the west coast of Thailand, the Andaman Sea is also at its calmest which makes it a perfect time to visit the west coast resorts such as Phuket, Krabi and the Ko Phi Phi islands.
                
            <br>If however you're heading to the east coast of Thailand (the gulf coast), such as Ko Samui or Ko Chang, the cool season sees this area hit by the northeast monsoon with consistent rain between October and January, peaking in November.</p>
